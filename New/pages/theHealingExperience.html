              Worldwide, as the number of external facilities grow and make sure
              of the fact that mankind is taken care of in every sense of the
              word. Minimizing time, effort and distance, this exponential
              emergence claims to refine the quality of life, but going to the
              core of the fact one would ask what does quality of life mean? And
              more importantly who determines this standard of quality? We as a
              naturally inquisitive species have invested ourselves in becoming
              the best version of ourselves to match the expectations of an
              increasingly intolerant society, the rat race seems like a mirage
              projecting a glorious struggle for perfection, but the flow from
              struggle to strife doesn’t take much time. The bed of roses soon
              turns into a bed of thorns. The constant search for fulfilment
              outside ourselves is definitely a frustrating experience yet
              something that is very normalised as we tend to live in this
              perpetual state of misery without noticing it. Pushing our tiny
              selves against the whole wide world we forget the simple fact that
              we are a part of the same world!
            </p>

              The return to a healthy state of being requires a great degree of
              personal work or popularly known as “self-help”. Maintaining
              health does not limit itself to taking prescribed pills or
              sticking to a healthy diet. Without personal work on ourself we
              eventually end up creating another problem leading us right back
              to square one. The idea of suffering is caused by the illusion of
              separateness, which generates fear and anxiety and eventually
              manifests into a physical ailment. As the world wakes up to these
              hard-hitting realities triggered by their own suffering (physical
              or mental illness), It's essential that we deal with the deeper
              meaning of our difficulties, to see if we listen to our whole self
              or are ignoring something important. On one level for people to
              understand the root of the matter, life presents such situations
              which cause pain, but on a deeper level it is a nudge towards
              waking up!

              As people start observing their way of life, they come to
              understand that their miseries are an outcome of their actions,
              that in reality they are the masters of their life and it’s up to
              them to take control and design it. When the understanding of the
              transience of life dawns upon us, we start to broaden our horizons
              of awareness to things beyond our conceptualization, things we had
              no idea even existed, for the sake of a more holistic way of
              living. As and when in the contemporary world we allow ourself to
              develop new sensitivities we begin to see the whole world
              differently, we begin to pay attention to aspects of life that
              seemed peripheral before, the terms like “good vibes” and “bad
              vibes” become household terms as we begin to step in and activate
              our senses beyond the figurative meaning of the same. Modern
              experiments suggest the existence of a bioplasmic energy field
              which is distinct from the three known states of matter, for the
              lack of a better word it can be referred to as the god particle.
              The system of Reiki is a leap of faith in this direction as it
              affirms the idea that the universe and human body is made up of
              energies, the word Reiki itself means the Universal or sacred life
              force. Modern science tells us that the human organism isn’t
              limited to the physical structure, moving from the world of static
              solid forms into the world of dynamic energy fields, we come to an
              understanding that just like the sea, we too ebb and flow. The
              human energy field is a manifestation of the universal energy that
              is intimately involved with human life, it can be described as a
              luminous body that surrounds and interpenetrates the physical
              body, each succeeding layer is composed of finer substances and
              higher vibrations, each layer is associated with a chakra which
              are swirling cone shaped vortexes. Energy flows into the chakras
              from the Universal energy field. It is important to open the
              chakras to increase our energy flow, the more energy we let flow,
              the healthier we are. We are literally like sponges in the sea of
              energy that surrounds us. Metabolizing energy from the universal
              field and dealing with the content of the consciousness that is
              associated with the energy is not that easy, therefore we work in
              tune with our level of consciousness so that we have the means to
              process the personal material that is released and make room for
              new understanding and information in our life. Each layer of the
              human energy field has its own particular function and is
              associated with a Chakra, each chakra having its own psychological
              and physical function as its distinction from other chakras. The
              first layer associated with the first Chakra, the second with
              second and so on. The first layer and the first chakra are
              associated with the physical functioning and the physical
              sensations (pain/pleasure), the first layer is concerned with
              automatic and autonomic functions of the body, the second layer
              and chakra are related to the emotional aspect of human life, the
              third chakra is connected with linear thinking, the fourth
              associated with the heart chakra is the vehicle through which we
              love, not only our surrounding but humanity in general, the fifth
              is connected to higher will, power of the word, taking
              responsibility for our actions, the sixth level is associated with
              celestial love, a quality of love that exists beyond the human
              range of love and engulfs all life, lastly the seventh layer is
              related to the higher mind, an integration of our spiritual and
              physical makeup. Understanding how any physical symptom is related
              to the location of the Chakra can help in determining the nature
              of the illness. Reiki’s ability to balance the Chakras and create
              a unity in mind, body and spirit connects us to the spring of
              wellness, from where creativity can blossom. This study of the
              human aura, the art of channelling Reiki can be a bridge between
              traditional medicine and psychological concerns. Nobody really
              understands how Reiki works, it’s a matter of practice for finding
              the truth, and the truth of the matter is even more enlightening
              as it’s a matter of trusting our intuition and becoming Reiki
              itself.
